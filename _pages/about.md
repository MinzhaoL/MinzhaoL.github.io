I am currently working as a **Research Associate** in the [**Programmable Networking Lab**](https://www.capabilities.unsw.edu.au/software-defined-networking-cyber-intelligence) at the **University of New South Wales (UNSW)**, Sydney, Australia.
I received my **B.Eng. (First Class Hons.)** and **Ph.D.** degree from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia in 2017 and 2022 respectively. 

My current research interests encompass **computer networks** with a specific focus on **analysing telecommunications network traffic** for on-demand **networked application Quality-of-Experience** and **network security**, leveraging novel tehniques of programmable networks, data-driven analytics, and machine learning.


The website also contains a list of my publications, blogs, teaching and professional services. You may also find me at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=6oFRlVcAAAAJ) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Minzhao-Lyu).

(***For Future Students***): Our group is continously looking for **PhD students**, **UNSW undergraduate/honours thesis students**, and **UNSW postgraduate project students** who are self-motivated and have strong background in computer networks and systems. If you are interested, please do not hestiate contacting me via email [**minzhao.lyu@unsw.edu.au**].
