I am currently working as a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** in the [**Programmable Networking Lab**](https://www.capabilities.unsw.edu.au/software-defined-networking-cyber-intelligence) at the **University of New South Wales (UNSW)**, Sydney, Australia.

I received my **B.Eng. (First Class Hons.)** and **Ph.D.** degree from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia in 2017 and 2022 respectively. I have worked at CSIROâ€™s Data61, Sydney, Australia as a student fellow and at National Telemedicine Center of China as a research intern. 

My current research interests fall in a broad range of **computer networks** with focuses on **(Terabit-speed) network traffic analytics**, **network security**, programmable networks, and machine learning for network problems.

The website also contains a list of my publications, tech blogs, teaching and professional services. You may also find me at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=6oFRlVcAAAAJ) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Minzhao-Lyu).

I am reachable via email [**minzhao.lyu@unsw.edu.au**] and open to discussions on emerging topics and potential collaborations.
